                <h2>Welcome to The Club!</h1>
                <p>The South Coast Surf Club was born of a need to have a place to meet with like-minded individuals, to share our experiences, give advice and, most importantly, to feel like you belong.  To be around others who understand that urge to dive into the sea, come rain or shine, winter or summer and to share the joy you feel when you catch <em>that</em> wave!</p>
                <p>We welcome people of all ages and skills.  Whether you're an old pro, a midlife newbie or a young shredder, we'd love to meet you.  We believe that spending this time together and sharing our knowledge can only help to spread the love for surfing and spending our life in the sea.</p>

                <h2>Where we meet</h2>
                <p>We tend to meet wherever we can find the best conditions.  This may not always be the <strong>biggest</strong> surf, but it will be the place where we can have the most fun!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We always try and cater for the many, not the few. Don't expect to always find the biggest surf, instead it'll be wherever is most accessible for those attending.</li>
                    <li>We have a small collection of surfboards for you to try out.  Whether you are just starting out and need a nice, friendly foamie, or whether you're looking to try out that shortboard without committing to buying it, we should have something suitable for you.</li>
                    <li>If you're really not confident in the water, please speak to one of the core members and we can try and book some 1 to 1 time in with you to help build your confidence.</li>
                    <li>We offer taster sessions for those who are thinking about joining us.  Please <a href="contact-us">contact us</a> for more information.</li>

                <h2>When we meet</h2>
                <p>We tend to meet whenever there is surf!  Failing that, when the surf is flat we have regular socials, so we can be found in pubs all along the south coast.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annual in-house surf contest - judged by the spectators!  Prizes for all winners and losers.</li>
                    <li>Annual Christmas bash.  Usually involving large amounts of alcohol and someone falling asleep under the pool table of a pub somewhere!</li>
                    <li>Spring Getaway - We try and have a blow-the-cobwebs-away getaway after the winter, usually somewhere hot and sunny.  Previous trips include Portugal, Morocco and Spain.</li>
